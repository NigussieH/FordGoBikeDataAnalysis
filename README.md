# GoBike System Data Exploration

## Dataset

This data set includes information about a bike-sharing system, Ford GoBike system, 
in California's San Francisco Bay Area.The dataset consisted of Trip Duration and 
attributes of approximately 18,3500 Ford GoBike Users. The attributes included the
User Type, Gender, User Birth Date, as well as additional measurements such as 
Station location,Trip Start Time - End Time. Some Columns were removed from the
analysis due to no need for them, age of User is added, and Trip Duration 
converted from seconds to Minutesfor more readability. the data download from https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv

## Summary of Findings

The number of Males is greater than females. Subscribers are greater than customers 
where the start station is the same end station.When performing more analysis on 
stations where the start station and end station are the same place I find that, 
more skewed observations when the start station is same to end station, with 
histogram of trip.


The multivariate exploration here showed that there indeed is a positive effect 
of Gender, but in the dataset there are a large Numbers of Male Users, which 
fetch a lower effect of gender on Trips Duration. gender also has an effect on
the duration of the trip && a when find the customers user type has longer on 
average compared to 'Subscriber' bikers.
